# GuessTheNumber
More detailed console version of the "Guess the number (1-100)" game.  

It includes the options to have the player guess the computer's number, as well as the computer guessing the player's number ( and in the case of the computer guessing - both randomly and not, the choice is left to the player). Oh, and different colors for the console too.
